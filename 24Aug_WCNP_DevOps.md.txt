
Workflow for WNCP deployment in detail:
Git -> Concord -> Looper -> Concord -> Kubernetes


Components of Kubernetes, smallest to largest:
-> Container : Microservices run inside of a container. Usually, there is one microservice per container.
-> Pod : Management wrapper around the container. Usually, 1:1 relationship between containers and pods.
-> Node : VM or physical machine responsible for running pods. Usually, one node would run many pods.
-> CLuster : Set of nodes that run containerized applications. Typically contains 5 to 500 nodes.


DevOps
-> Systematic approach to integrate people, tools, processes, and products to accelerate application delivery.
-> Improves collaboration â€” from planning, building, deploying and operating, to supporting. 
-> Focuses on end-user success and increases productivity by:
	1) Removing waste
	2) Continuously deploying innovative solutions
	3) Improving quality and efficiency
	4) Reducing cost
